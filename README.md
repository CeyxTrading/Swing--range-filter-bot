# Swing--range-filter-bot
A quick project attempting to translate Pine Script to Python so there may be some mistakes

In order to identify bullish/bearish trends the indicator measures price ranges and changes over a predetermined time period.

The range filter itself, up- and downward indicators, high- and low-band indicators, and long- and short-entry indicators are all included in the script.

As a tool for technical analysis, it can be used to measure the limits of price movement over a given time period. The majority of the time, markets are occupied by trading ranges, with only 15% to 20% of the time being spent in up and down trends.

These ranges can be quite narrow or quite broad. By identifying the characteristics of price movements within the ranges, the range filter attempts to predict future trends.
